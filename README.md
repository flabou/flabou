- 👋 Hi, I’m François Laboureur, I'm a hardware and software electronics engineer from Belgium.
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, embedded systems, software engineering, [CAO and 3D printing](https://www.youmagine.com/francois-laboureur/designs), and technology in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Rust programing language, and Kicad.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a new job in electronics (hardware and software), in an english speaking environment somewhere else than Belgium where I currently live. 
It's okay if the local language outside of work is not english, I can learn. I want a new experience, to learn new things and to meet new people.
Ideally I would love to work in a company with an inspiring mission and great values, that is helpful to humanity.
- 📫 The best way to contact me for a job currently is through my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoislaboureur/). I will try to answer you if you mention that you had a look at my github profile.
